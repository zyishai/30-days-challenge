# 30-days-challenge
30 days frontend challenge

## Overview
This challenge will take place during 30 consecutives days (except Fri-Sat), and in each day I'll try to build (one of the following or both):
- One static page with Tailwindcss (to practice structure and design of webpage).
- One dynamic component using Svelte, React or both.

I'll also maintain a DEVLOG.md file to track my progress.
After this challenge, I should have 30 dynamic components, 30 static pages and lots of small experiences with Tailwind, React and Svelte.

Starting today - good luck!
